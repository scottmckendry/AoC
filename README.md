> Benchmarks are run via [this GitHub Action](https://github.com/scottmckendry/aoc/actions/workflows/readmeStats.yml) and are not indicative of the performance of the code on your machine.
> The action uses the `ubuntu-latest` image and runs each solution 100 times to get an average. This is by no means a perfect benchmark, so take the results below with a grain of salt.
